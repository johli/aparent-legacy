		apa_sym_prx_dna_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and cluster the Miseq Plasmid reads, outputting a set of unique DNA sequence variants.
			The clustering pass groups together sequences with 20bp barcodes <= 4 hamming distance.
			Canonical sequences per cluster are retrieved by base-pair voting.

			Filters:
			1. Edit distance between read 1 and rc of read 2 <= 1.
			2. Read one must contain sequences CATTACTCGCATCCA and CAGCCAATTAAGCC (allowing 1 substitution error for each sequence).
			3. At least two reads required per unique sequence variant cluster.

		apa_sym_prx_rna_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and filter the Nextseq RNA reads, determining by local alignment where the RNA was polyadenylated (proximal cut position or distal).
			Do local pairwise alignment (using scikit-bios local_pairwise_align) between short RNA read and reference Plasmid sequence.
			If the read maps to a location in the proximal part of the UTR (with align score >= 30 / 50 bps), record the position and classify as proximal.
			Otherwise, if the short reads maps to the distal part of the UTR (with align score >= 30 / 50 bps), classify as distal.

			Filters:
			1. Filter out reads with barcodes  that do not map to any Plasmid DNA sequence barcode (within 1 substitution error).
			2. Filter out reads that cannot be aligned (score < 30) to either the proximal or distal part of the Plasmid UTR.

		apa_sym_prx_library_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Map the filtered RNA reads to the DNA sequence variants, accumulating isoform read counts.
			RNA reads are mapped to DNA sequence by matching their barcodes, allowing 1 substitution error / 20 bps.
			Only accumulate isoform counts for unique UMIs (differ by at least 1bp) per sequence variant.
			
			Classify an isoform as 5' Proximal if the short read aligned to 10-24bps downstream of the 5' pPAS.
			Classify an isoform as 3' Proximal if the short read aligned to 10-24bps downstream of the 3' pPAS.
			Classify an isoform as Distal if the short read aligned to 10-30bps downstream of the dPAS.
			
			Filters:
			1. Filter out reads that do not fall into any of the three isoform categories above.
			2. Filter out reads with an align score < 60 / 50 bps.
			3. Filter out reads not passing the anti-mispriming heuristic:
				If 3 A's are found within the 4 immediate bps following the read alignment start position, the read is misprimed.
				If 4 A's are found within the 7 immediate bps following the read alignment start position, the read is misprimed.
				If 5 A's are found within the 8 immediate bps following the read alignment start position, the read is misprimed.
				If 6 A's are found within the 9 immediate bps following the read alignment start position, the read is misprimed.
				Otherwise, the read is not misprimed.
