		apa_nextseq_v2_dna_processing_v2.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and cluster the TOMM5 Miseq reads, outputting a set of unique DNA sequence variants.
			The clustering pass groups together sequences with upstream regions <= 4 hamming distance.
			Canonical sequences per cluster are retrieved by base-pair voting.

			Filters:
			1. Sequence CAGACACAGCTC (within 1 substitution error) must be present in read 2.
			2. The regions flanking each side of the randomized regions must match the wildtype sequence (within 1 substitution error / 10bps).
			3. The sequence in read 1 must not match any of the N10-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 30 bps).
			4. The sequence in read 2 must match one of the N20-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 20 bps).
			5. The sequence from the start of the 5' random region to the end of the 3'random region is not allowed to contain any indels.

		apa_nextseq_v2_rna_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and filter the TOMM5 Nextseq RNA reads, classifying each read as proximal or distal.
			The read is classified as distal if the wildtype regions flanking the downstream N20 is found in read 1 with at most 4 substitution errors / 20 bps.
			Else if 20bps of A:s (allowing 3 substitution errors) are found in read 1, the read is classified as proximal.

			Filters:
			1. The wildtype regions flanking the upstream N40 must be found in read 1 with at most 4 substitution errors / 20 bps.

		apa_nextseq_v2_distal_rna_processing_v2.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and cluster distal Nextseq RNA reads, outputting a set of unique sequence variants.
			The Miseq data was missing coverage on some of the sublibraries. This dataset is intended to complement that coverage.

			Filters:
			1. The regions flanking each side of the randomized regions must match the wildtype sequence (within 1 substitution error / 10bps).
			2. The sequence in read 1 must not match any of the N10-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 30 bps).
			3. The sequence in read 2 must match one of the N20-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 20 bps).
			4. The sequence from the start of the 5' random region to the end of the 3'random region is not allowed to contain any indels.


		apa_nextseq_v2_dna_merging_v2.ipynb
			Function:
			Merge together the Sequence variants from the Miseq data with the variants extracted from distal RNA reads.

			Filters:
			1. Only keep Miseq sequence variants with read count >= 2
			2. Only keep Nextseq distal read sequence variants with read count >= 5

		apa_nextseq_v2_library_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Map the filtered RNA reads to the DNA sequence variants, accumulating isoform read counts and cleavage positions.
			RNA reads are mapped to DNA sequence by matching their upstream regions, allowing 1 substitution error / 20 bps.

			Filters:
			1. Only accumulate isoform read counts from unique UMI:s. Unique UMI:s must be at least 2 bps apart (the UMI is 6 bp long).
