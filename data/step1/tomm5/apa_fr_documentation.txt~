		apa_nextseq_v2_dna_processing_v2.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and cluster the TOMM5 Miseq reads, outputting a set of unique DNA sequence variants.
			The clustering pass groups together sequences with upstream regions <= 4 hamming distance.
			Canonical sequences per cluster are retrieved by base-pair voting.

			Filters:
			1. Sequence CAGACACAGCTC (within 1 substitution error) must be present in read 2.
			2. The regions flanking each side of the randomized regions must match the wildtype sequence (within 1 substitution error / 10bps).
			3. The sequence in read 1 must not match any of the N10-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 30 bps).
			4. The sequence in read 2 must match one of the N20-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 20 bps).
			5. The sequence from the start of the 5' random region to the end of the 3'random region is not allowed to contain any indels.

		apa_nextseq_v2_rna_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and filter the TOMM5 Nextseq RNA reads, classifying each read as proximal or distal.
			The read is classified as distal if the wildtype regions flanking the downstream N20 is found in read 1 with at most 4 substitution errors / 20 bps.
			Else if 20bps of A:s (allowing 3 substitution errors) are found in read 1, the read is classified as proximal.

			Filters:
			1. The wildtype regions flanking the upstream N40 must be found in read 1 with at most 4 substitution errors / 20 bps.

		apa_nextseq_v2_distal_rna_processing_v2.ipynb
			Function:
			Extract and cluster distal Nextseq RNA reads, outputting a set of unique sequence variants.
			The Miseq data was missing coverage on some of the sublibraries. This dataset is intended to complement that coverage.

			Filters:
			1. The regions flanking each side of the randomized regions must match the wildtype sequence (within 1 substitution error / 10bps).
			2. The sequence in read 1 must not match any of the N10-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 30 bps).
			3. The sequence in read 2 must match one of the N20-libraries (within 3 substitution errors / 20 bps).
			4. The sequence from the start of the 5' random region to the end of the 3'random region is not allowed to contain any indels.


		apa_nextseq_v2_dna_merging_v2.ipynb
			Function:
			Merge together the Sequence variants from the Miseq data with the variants extracted from distal RNA reads.

			Filters:
			1. Only keep Miseq sequence variants with read count >= 2
			2. Only keep Nextseq distal read sequence variants with read count >= 5

		apa_nextseq_v2_library_processing.ipynb
			Function:
			Map the filtered RNA reads to the DNA sequence variants, accumulating isoform read counts and cleavage positions.
			RNA reads are mapped to DNA sequence by matching their upstream regions, allowing 1 substitution error / 20 bps.

			Filters:
			1. Only accumulate isoform read counts from unique UMI:s. Unique UMI:s must be at least 2 bps apart (the UMI is 6 bp long).

	--Scripts for creating analytical datasets from library:

		process_data_apa_mer_combined_v4.py
			Function:
			Creates dataset of input features and output target values.
			Used for training machine learning models (LR, CNN).
			This script creates K-mer features, K-mer-position features, and 1-Hot-Encodings for CNN.

			Filters:
			1. Keep only library members with an unaltered, wt, PAS region (CTAAAATATAAAACT).
	
	--Scripts for creating new sequence variants for de novo APA site:
		
		emit_pas_library.py
			Function:
			Given the processed apa_fr library file, creates a new library file where de novo APA sites
			have been extracted and aligned, turning them into new sequence variants (or data points).
			
			If a new PAS-signal (within 2 substitutions from AATAAA) is found in the upstream randomized N40-region,
			the script creates a new sequence variant that is centered around the de novo signal.
			The reads mapping to a cleavage position upstream of the original pPAS (or onto the pPAS) are treated as the isoform counts
			for the de novo signal.
			
			Each sequence variant in the new library file has three counts associated with it:
			Proximal count - Number of isoform counts consistent with the centered-on PAS (either the original pPAS or a de novo signal).
			Total count vs. All - Total number of isoform counts (De novo signal + Original Proximal PAS + Distal PAS).
			Total count vs. Distal - Total number of Proximal + Distal counts for the current centered-on PAS (either the original pPAS or a de novo signal + Distal PAS).
		
		process_data_apa_mer_de_novo.py
			Function:
			Creates dataset of input features and output target values for the de novo library.
			Used for training machine learning models (LR, CNN).
			This script creates K-mer features, K-mer-position features, and 1-Hot-Encodings for CNN.
